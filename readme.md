# About
This GitHub project highlights my expertise in frontend development, specifically in crafting a versatile web application tailored for showcasing pottery goods and enabling seamless e-commerce transactions. Built with React, Redux, Redux Toolkit (RTK), and JavaScript, I've developed a robust and intuitive platform for browsing and purchasing pottery items. Leveraging PropTypes for type-checking ensures data integrity, while RTK Query facilitates smooth data fetching, enhancing the overall user experience.

In addition to e-commerce features such as adding items to the basket, removing them, and drag-and-drop functionality, the application boasts multi-language support powered by i18n. This feature enables users to browse the site in their preferred language, enhancing accessibility and usability. By utilizing functional components, I've streamlined code organization and maintenance, ensuring scalability and ease of future development. Furthermore, the integration of local storage enhances personalized user interactions, providing a seamless shopping experience for pottery enthusiasts worldwide.

# Features
* Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Enhancing user convenience, the application incorporates drag-and-drop functionality, enabling users to effortlessly rearrange items within their shopping basket. This intuitive feature empowers users to customize their shopping experience, organizing items according to their preferences with ease.

* Multi-Language Support: With built-in internationalization (i18n) features, the platform caters to a global audience by offering support for multiple languages. Users can seamlessly switch between languages, ensuring a localized experience that enhances accessibility and user engagement across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\

* Responsive Design: The landing page is designed with a responsive layout, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across devices of different screen sizes. Whether accessed on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the website adapts seamlessly to provide a consistent and user-friendly experience.
